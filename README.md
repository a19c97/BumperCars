# BumperCars

An exceedingly ambitious project that simulates bumper cars. Self-destructive bumper cars. And self-driving bumper cars. Fun, right?

## 1. The Story

The idea came to me one Friday night, when my friend and I were at the Canada's Wonderland Halloween Haunt. We were both too wimpy to go on roller coasters and too lazy to line up for haunted houses, so we rode bumper cars. Repeatedly. The bumper car arena at Wonderland was a rather small loop crammed with way too many cars. Once the turn started, the cars would get stuck despite the drivers' best efforts, and the conductors had to constantly shout out orders for them to disentangle themselves. 

"See, if all these cars were self-driving, we wouldn't have this mess." I remarked to my friend.

"Yeah, they would all just be whizzing around the track in perfect order. But it wouldn't be very fun, would it?"

True. "Well, maybe we can maximize collision instead."

"How would we measure that?"

"Say, maximizing velocity when they bump into each other?"

And that gave birth to the bumper car project.

Let's be honest - what fun is bumper cars that drive themselves?
